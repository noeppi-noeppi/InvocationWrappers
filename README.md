# InvocationWrappers

**This project is WIP**

InvocationWrappers provides a way similiar to Proxies to wrap around an abject and do something when a method is called.

For now you have to understand the code yourself. Documentation wil follow.

Will definitely not work on java < 8

Will probably not work on java > 8. Test it yourself.
